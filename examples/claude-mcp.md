# Claude MCP Examples

This repository focuses on routing MCP tools, but you can connect Claude in two common ways.

## Claude Desktop (stdio)

Claude Desktop reads MCP server definitions from `claude_desktop_config.json`.
See `examples/claude-desktop-config.json` for a minimal example that connects Claude Desktop to `claude mcp serve`.
