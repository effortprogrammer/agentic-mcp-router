# mcpflow

Smart tool routing for [OpenCode](https://opencode.ai). Reduces MCP tool context usage
through smart search, working-set management, and on-demand tool loading.

## The Problem

When you configure many MCP servers in OpenCode, every tool definition is sent to
the LLM on every turn — leaving less context for your actual conversation and code.

## The Solution

mcpflow sits between OpenCode and your MCP servers, exposing only **3 meta-tools**:

| Tool                  | Purpose                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `router_select_tools` | Search for relevant tools by query |
| `router_call_tool`    | Call a tool by `{serverId}:{toolName}`             |
| `router_tool_info`    | Inspect a tool's full schema before calling it     |

```
User: "Create a GitHub PR"
  → OpenCode calls: router_select_tools({ query: "github pull request" })
  → Router returns: [{ toolId: "github:create_pull_request", ... }]
  → OpenCode calls: router_call_tool({ toolId: "github:create_pull_request", arguments: {...} })
```

## Quick Start

**3 commands and you're done:**

```bash
# 1. Install and configure mcpflow (auto-updates your OpenCode config)
npx @mcpflow/cli opencode install

# 2. Start OpenCode — it auto-loads mcpflow
# (no manual config needed!)

# 3. Verify it works
# Open Settings → MCP Servers → should see "router" with 3 tools
```

That's it! mcpflow automatically:
- ✅ Disables your existing MCP servers
- ✅ Configures itself as single MCP entry
- ✅ Starts managing all your tools via smart search

### Install from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/effortprogrammer/mcpflow.git
cd mcpflow
npm install && npm run build
pip install -e router-runtime/
npx @mcpflow/cli opencode install
```
